A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed to be
configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing, hence the term
field-programmable. The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a
hardware description language (HDL), similar to that used for an application-
specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Circuit diagrams were previously used to
specify the configuration, but this is increasingly rare due to the advent of
electronic design automation tools. 012345678901234
